- T-R and T-W
If your hardware features RTC support the commands T-R (time read) and T-W
(time write) are available. If the RTC isn't present, both commands return
30,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00; if the RTC is present but not set correctly T-R will
return 31,SYNTAX ERROR,00,00.

Both commands expect a fourth character that specifies the time format
to be used. T-W expects that the new time follows that character
with no space or other characters inbetween. For the A, B and D
formats, the expected input format is exactly the same as returned
by T-R with the same format character; for the I format the day of
week is ignored and calculated based on the date instead.

The possible formats are:
- "A"SCII: "SUN. 01/20/08 01:23:45 PM"+CHR$(13)
The day-of-week string can be any of "SUN.", "MON.", "TUES", "WED.",
"THUR", "FRI.", "SAT.". The year field is modulo 100.

- "B"CD or "D"ecimal:
Both these formats use 9 bytes to specify the time. For BCD everything
is BCD-encoded, for Decimal the numbers are sent/parsed as-is.
Byte 0: Day of the week (0 for sunday)
1: Year (modulo 100 for BCD; -1900 for Decimal, i.e. 108 for 2008)
2: Month (1-based)
3: Day (1-based)
4: Hour (1-12)
5: Minute (0-59)
6: Second (0-59)
7: AM/PM-Flag (0 is AM, everything else is PM)
8: CHR$(13)

When the time is set a year less than 80 is interpreted as 20xx.

- "I"SO 8601 subset: "2008-01-20T13:23:45 SUN"+CHR$(13)
This format complies with ISO 8601 and adds a day of week
abbreviation using the same table as the A format, but omitting
the fourth character. When it is used with T-W, anything beyond
the seconds field is ignored and the day of week is calculated
based on the specified date. The year must always be specified
including the century if this format is used to set the time.
To save space, sd2iec only accepts this particular date/time
representation when setting the time with T-WI and no other ISo
8601-compliant representation.

Example:

@T-WASAT. 05/03/14 09:45:33 PM
@
00:OK:00

@T-R
@
SAT. 05/03/14 09:46:54 PM

------------------------------

Clock setting is a bit picky, expanding on the section below on clock setting

Example full command:

@T-WASUN. 01/20/08 01:23:45 PM

IMPORTANT NOTE : there is NO SPACE between the COMMAND T-WA and the DAY.

IMPORTANT NOTE : there IS a space between the time and PM if used


NOTE : "TUES" and "THUR" are the only day names of 4 letters, the rest are 3 letters and a full stop e.g. "MON."
