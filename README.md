VIC-20 Final Expansion 3 Rev 11 Cartridge

This repository contains everything needed to produce a Final Expansion Rev 11 cartridge for the VIC-20 computer.  It's a bit unorganized but the latest versions of the files should be the ones to use.

This project was created to make assembly easier than earlier versions of the Final Expansion 3 cartridge.

The board layouts were created by Fredric Bl√•holtz.  The 3D case design were created by Thomas Christoph.  The labels, BOM, and most of the other project files were created by Heather Kent.  Preloaded games were prvided by Jeff Daniels of the VIC-20 Denial forum (sleepingelephant.com/ipw-web/bulletin/bb/index.php).  Firmware and other files were created by others.

The 3D Case design has a different license that allows for printing your own case but you are not allowed to sell them.  Read the license in the zip file for details on the license limitations.
