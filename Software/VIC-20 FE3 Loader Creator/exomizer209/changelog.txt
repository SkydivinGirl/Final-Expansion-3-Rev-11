2015-09-21
Release of 2.0.9 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix gcc-compiler warnings.
+ sfx decr src comments echoed to stdout, reported by iAN CooG, fix by soci.
+ NULL pointer dereference crash, reported by Flavio, fix by soci.

2015-09-20
Release of 2.0.8 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug reported and analyzed by Adrien Destugues. The ECHO token in asm.y
  collides with the flex ECHO macro. The cause is that Bison 2.3a and newer
  stopped to generate defines for the declared tokens. To resolve this the ECHO
  token has been renamed to ECHO1.
+ Add -E flag to not write the encoding to the outfile.
+ Remove max nr of chunks limit from the chunkpool allocator.
+ Enforce match max_len everwhere, bug reported by Zik / Futurs.

2013-04-14
Release of 2.0.7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Bugfixed commodore sfx targets to automatically disable irq when decrunching
  over system areas. This together with moving the table to zero-page,
  -Di_table_addr=0x2, allows decrunching $0200-<end of mem> without corruption
  for all commodore targets except for the vic20-configs without a 3kB memory
  expansion since they have a memory hole at $0400-$1000.
+ Bugfixed z80 decrunchers from Metalbrain.
+ Bugfixed sfx c16/plus4 target where the default irq could corrupt memory
  while decrunching data that covers $07f6-$0800, reported by Luca/FIRE.
+ Bugfixed sfx c16/plus4 target where the default decrunch effect could corrupt
  memory while decrunching data that covers $0be7, reported by Luca/FIRE.
+ Added feature to sfx-mode that complains if the data it too big to fit in the
  available memory of the selected target, suggested by Luca/FIRE.
+ Added c16 target, -t 4, like -t4 but with smaller memory, suggested by
  Luca/FIRE.

2013-01-27
Release of 2.0.6 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ New improvements to the z80 decrunchers, again smaller and faster.

2013-01-12
Release of 2.0.5 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Add -C and -M <length> flags that trades crunch result for speed. It is now
  possible to really speed up crunching, even for "worst case"-type files.
+ Now skips the DAG traversing of the final pass if the encoding hasn't changed
  since the previous pass.

2012-08-16
Release of 2.0.4 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Bug in z80 decrunchers fixed by Metalbrain. Thanks goes to Hervé Monchatre
  and Tim Riemann (Octoate) for reporting.
+ Implement sfx basic for the Apple II target.
+ Improve documentation slightly for the sfx and level commands.

2012-03-25
Release of 2.0.3 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.

+ Added 6809-decruncher contributed by Edouard Forler.
+ Fix language errors in the documentation. Thanks to Csabo/LOD.
+ Remove bogus printout about the default decrunch effect when using a custom
  decrunch effect. Bug reported by Csabo/LOD.
+ Fix bug that prevented the correct error message from showing when trying to
  combine a basic start and a non rom config for the sfx command.  Bug reported
  by iAN CooG.

2011-02-06
Release of 2.0.1 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug in log.c that caused the desfx command to loop if the log level was
  lower than debug. Bug report by iAN CooG.
2011-01-22
Release of 2.0 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug in sfx decruncher setup where data was copied unnecessary. Triggered
  by using -Di_load_addr, reported by nbla000
+ Add i_line_number symbol to be able to change the default line number of the
  basic line of the sfx decruncher. Feature suggested by Chicken
+ 6502 emulator core now features memory read/write callbacks
+ Add desfx -e flag to override the automatic entry point detection, feature
  suggestion with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat,
  error handling added)
+ Fix desfx handling of files that decrunch to and including 0xffff, Bug report
  with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat, end addresses
  are exclusive everywhere else)
+ Fix argument handling of desfx, Bug report + patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.

2008-09-08
Release of 2.0beta7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Refactored some functions from exo_main.c and exo_helper.c into a new file,
  exo_util.c so the testprogram could use them too.
+ Fixed a bug in exo_main where the sys/call basic token was mixed up with
  the basic_txt_start. This confused thes sfx sys sub-command.
+ Fixed a bug in krilldecr.s. The handling of literal sequences longer than
  256 bytes was broken.
+ Added a testprogram to test that the decrunchers in the exodecrs folder
  works. This feature uses the 6502 emulation core to run test programs. It
  tests literal sequences longer than 256 bytes and run lengths longer than 256
  bytes for all four decruncher variants, backward, forward, streaming and
  chunk streaming.
+ Added a z80 decruncher contributed by Metalbrain.
+ Added an experimental desfx command that should be able to decrunch sfx
  crunched files. Uses the 6502 emulation core to run the sfx-decrunchers.
+ Added a 6502 emulator core.
+ Fix rare situation when sfxdecr.s failed to assemble.
+ Improve the help text when no sub-command is given.
+ Improve the handling of ROM/RAM-banking and NMIs for the atari target in the
  sfx decruncher.
+ Fix broken op definition ldy abs,x in the sfx assembler, bug reported by
   Stefano Tognon.

  reported by MagerValp.
+ Add a dasm version of the exodecruncher source.

2006-07-08
Release of 2.0beta4 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.

+ Don't use setjmp/longjmp due to obscure bug when building for mingw with -O3
  -fomit-frame-pointer. Bug reported by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
+ Add multipass functionality to the assembler in order to be able to do more
  complex things in the decruncher source.
+ fix the sfx decruncher to work for a wider range of i_load_addr values.
  Bug reported by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
+ Add optional offset,len for raw command file reading.

+ Effect shorthands -n for no effect, -x1 for Accumulator based border flash,
  -x2 for X-register based border flash and -x3 for Y-register based border
  flash. -x<fast effect assembler fragment> -X<slow effect assembler fragment>

  char is slow.
+ Added flag -x<effect assembler fragment> to the sfx command.
+ Improved docs about the mem command and assembler symbols.
+ fixed spelling bug in i_effect=2 mode. Bug found by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
